/**
 * This contains the fully analyzed results for a drive, this is returned from
 * `-[ZendriveDelegateProtocol processAnalysisOfDrive:]` callback for all the trips with the value of
 * `ZendriveDriveInfo.driveType` not set to `ZendriveDriveType.ZendriveDriveTypeInvalid`.
 *
 * The data of this type will always be of equal or better quality than
 * `ZendriveEstimatedDriveInfo` returned from `-[ZendriveDelegateProtocol processEndOfDrive:]`
 *
 * Typically `-[ZendriveDelegateProtocol processAnalysisOfDrive:]` will be fired within
 * a few seconds after `-[ZendriveDelegateProtocol processEndOfDrive:]` callback but in some rare cases
 * this delay can be really large depending on phone network conditions.
 *
 * The callback for this `-[ZendriveDelegateProtocol processAnalysisOfDrive:]` will be fired in trip
 * occurrence sequence, i.e. from oldest trip to the latest trip.
